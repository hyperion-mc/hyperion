# 10,000 Player PvP Event

Our pilot event is a 10,000 player PvP battle to break the Guinness World Record for the largest PvP battle ever.

We're partnering with [TheMisterEpic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJiFgnnYpwlnadzTzhMnX_Q) to run an initial
proof-of-concept event with around 2k players. Following its success, we'll host the full-scale 10,000 player PvP battle
alongside numerous YouTubers and streamers.

Our event will be a massive Bed Wars game consisting of teams with hundreds of players each.
