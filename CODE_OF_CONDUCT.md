# Hyperion Code of Conduct

## Our Focus

Hyperion is a high-performance Minecraft game engine. Our community prioritizes technical excellence, candid communication, and solution-oriented collaboration. This Code of Conduct emphasizes what actually matters for our project's success.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on Technical Merit
- Judge contributions based on technical merit, not who wrote them
- Prioritize performance, correctness, and maintainability
- Back up opinions with benchmarks, code, or technical reasoning

### 2. Direct Communication
- Be candid and straightforward in technical discussions
- Critical feedback on code and ideas is encouraged and valuable
- Focus criticism on the work, not the person
- Don't sugarcoat technical problems; identify issues clearly

### 3. Solutions Over Complaints
- Identify problems, but prioritize proposing solutions
- "Here's how we could fix this..." is more valuable than "This is broken"
- When disagreeing, offer alternatives rather than just objections

### 4. Respect Time and Effort
- Come prepared to discussions and code reviews
- Research before asking questions that are documented
- Value others' time as much as your own
- Follow through on commitments

### 5. Technical Debates Welcome
- Vigorous technical debates are encouraged
- Defend your position with evidence and reasoning
- Be willing to change your position when presented with better evidence
- Remember that the goal is the best solution, not winning arguments

### 6. Basic Professional Respect
- Don't be deliberately antagonistic or hostile
- No personal attacks, harassment, or targeted disruption
- Assume competence and good intentions in technical disagreements

## Practical Enforcement

1. **First occurrence**: Private message explaining the specific behavior that crossed the line
2. **Continued behavior**: Temporary cool-down period from specific communication channels
3. **Persistent issues**: Removal from the project

Enforcement focuses on behavior patterns, not isolated incidents of heated technical discussion or candid feedback.

## Scope

This Code applies to all Hyperion project spaces, including GitHub, Discord, and official events.

## Implementation

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. Violations can be reported to the maintainers via Discord DM or email.
