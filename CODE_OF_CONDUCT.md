# Hyperion Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the Hyperion community, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free and productive experience for everyone. We value technical excellence, direct communication, and solution-oriented collaboration while ensuring respect for all community members regardless of age, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, race, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Technical Conduct
Examples of behavior that contributes to a productive technical environment:

* Focusing on technical merit rather than who wrote the code
* Providing clear, evidence-based feedback on contributions
* Backing up opinions with benchmarks, code examples, or technical reasoning
* Proposing solutions alongside criticisms
* Being direct and candid in technical discussions while remaining respectful
* Valuing performance, correctness, and maintainability

### Community Conduct
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive community environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from experience
* Focusing on what's best for the overall community and project

### Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Personal attacks, public or private harassment
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Persistent unconstructive criticism that offers no solutions
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Balance of Values

Hyperion values both:
* Candid, direct technical communication that doesn't sugarcoat problems
* A respectful, inclusive environment where everyone can participate

These values can coexist. Direct feedback should focus on the work, not the person. Technical debates are encouraged, but should remain professional and evidence-based.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction

**Response**: A private message explaining the issue and why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Impact**: A pattern of inappropriate behavior or a single serious incident.  
**Response**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior, potentially including a specified period of no interaction.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact**: Serious or sustained violations of community standards.  
**Response**: Temporary ban from community interaction for a specified period.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact**: Pattern of serious violations or harassment.  
**Response**: Permanent ban from community participation.

## Scope
