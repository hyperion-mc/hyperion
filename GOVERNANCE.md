# Hyperion Governance Model

## Vision

Hyperion embraces a governance model that balances technical excellence with community wisdom. We believe the best decisions emerge when diverse perspectives meet rigorous engineering principles.

## Core Governance Structures

Hyperion's governance consists of three complementary bodies:

### 1. Technical Leadership Council (TLC)
- Expert-driven body responsible for day-to-day technical decisions
- Consists of 3-7 maintainers with demonstrated technical excellence
- Manages code reviews, architecture, and technical standards
- Members selected based on merit and contribution history

### 2. Hyperion Assembly
- Randomly selected contributors who serve as the community's voice
- Provides diverse perspectives on major decisions
- Reviews and approves non-technical policies and strategic direction
- Serves as a check and balance to the Technical Leadership Council

### 3. Project Stewards
- 2-3 individuals who maintain the long-term vision of Hyperion
- Includes the project founder @andrewgazelka
- Final arbiters in case of governance deadlocks
- Responsible for sustainability and mission alignment

## The Hyperion Assembly in Detail

### Purpose
The Hyperion Assembly brings deliberative democracy principles to open source governance, ensuring decisions reflect the broader community wisdom while respecting technical requirements.

### Composition
- 9-15 members randomly selected from qualified contributors
- Qualification requires at least one accepted contribution
- Weighted selection giving higher chance to more active contributors
- Term limits of 6 months with staggered rotation (1/3 rotated every 2 months)
- Diversity of technical backgrounds specifically sought

### Powers and Responsibilities
- Reviews and approves:
    - Major features and roadmap priorities
    - Community policies and processes
    - Resource allocation for sponsored work
    - Changes to the governance model
- Provides input on technical direction without overriding technical necessities
- Creates working groups to address specific community needs
- Conducts regular community surveys and feedback sessions

### Decision Process
- Assembly meets monthly in public sessions
- Consensus-seeking on most matters
- Structured deliberation process:
    1. Information gathering phase
    2. Structured debate with equal speaking time
    3. Proposal crafting
    4. Consensus building or voting (80% supermajority for approval)
- Technical Leadership Council holds limited veto rights on decisions that compromise technical stability or performance

## Contribution and Decision Flow

### For Code Changes

1. **Minor Changes** (bug fixes, small features):
    - Standard pull request process
    - Requires one TLC member approval
    - 48-hour waiting period for objections

2. **Significant Technical Changes**:
    - Requires RFC (Request for Comments)
    - 7-day comment period
    - TLC review and approval (majority vote)
    - Implementation via pull requests

3. **Major Strategic Changes**:
    - Joint decision between TLC and Assembly
    - TLC creates technical assessment
    - Assembly deliberates and votes (80% threshold)
    - Project Stewards can request reconsideration if deemed necessary

### For Community and Policy Changes

1. **Proposal Creation**:
    - Any contributor can submit proposals
    - Standard template in GitHub Discussions

2. **Initial Screening**:
    - Assembly moderators check for completeness
    - Categorize and prioritize proposals

3. **Deliberation**:
    - Public comment period (14 days)
    - Assembly discussion and structured debate
    - Revision based on community feedback

4. **Decision**:
    - Assembly voting (80% approval required)
    - Results and rationale documented publicly

## Performance and Technical Excellence

Technical excellence remains paramount:

1. All governance processes must respect the performance-critical nature of Hyperion
2. Assembly members receive technical briefings to understand performance implications
3. TLC holds final authority on purely technical matters
4. Benchmark-driven decision making for performance-critical systems

## Evolution and Amendment

This governance model evolves through:

1. Annual review of governance effectiveness
2. Amendment proposals can come from Assembly or TLC
3. Amendments require 80% Assembly approval AND majority TLC approval
4. Project Stewards confirm amendments align with project vision

## Conflict Resolution

1. Technical disagreements follow a technical dispute resolution process via TLC
2. Governance disagreements are resolved through structured mediation in the Assembly
3. Deadlocks between TLC and Assembly referred to Project Stewards

## Practical Implementation

The Hyperion Assembly will be established in phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Initial Assembly selected from active contributors
2. **Establishment Phase**: First random selection after 6 months
3. **Maturity Phase**: Full implementation of staggered terms
