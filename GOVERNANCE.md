# Hyperion Governance

This document outlines the simple governance structure for Hyperion, a high-performance Minecraft game engine.

## Project Roles

### 1. Project Lead
- Project founder (@andrewgazelka) and other designated leads
- Has final authority on project direction
- Controls access to critical resources (repositories, hosting, domains)
- Resolves disputes when consensus cannot be reached

### 2. Core Contributors
- Demonstrated consistent high-quality contributions
- Push access to all repositories
- Can approve significant changes
- Help shape project direction

### 3. Contributors
- Anyone who has contributed to the project
- No special permissions, but acknowledged for their work
- May be nominated for Core Contributor status

## Decision Making

### Code Changes
- Minor changes (bug fixes, small improvements) need one Core Contributor approval
- Major changes (API, architecture) need discussion and two Core approvals
- Core Contributors can merge their own minor changes for areas they maintain
- Always prioritize performance, scalability, and stability

### Project Direction
- Major decisions are discussed openly in GitHub issues or Discord
- Core Contributors aim for consensus on important matters
- If consensus cannot be reached, Project Lead makes the final decision
- Technical merit and alignment with project goals are primary criteria

## Becoming a Core Contributor

1. Make consistent contributions to the project
2. Demonstrate understanding of performance-critical game engine architecture
3. Get nominated by an existing Core Contributor
4. Receive approval from at least two Core Contributors including one Lead

## Code Review

We value quick iteration while maintaining technical excellence:

- Focus reviews on correctness, performance, and maintainability
- Include performance benchmarks for changes to critical paths
- Ensure adequate test coverage for new features
- Use GitHub Pull Requests for all changes
- Prefer small, focused changes over large changes
- Document design decisions that affect scalability

## Communication

- GitHub Issues: Technical discussions and bug reports
- Discord: Community support and development coordination
- Technical discussions should be direct and solution-oriented
- Focus on the work, not the person

## Conflict Resolution

1. Technical disagreements should first be discussed on relevant issues/PRs
2. If unresolved, Core Contributors discuss and seek consensus
3. Project Lead makes final decision when consensus cannot be reached

## Moderation

- Follow the Hyperion Code of Conduct
- Violations can be reported to project leads via Discord DM or email
- Project Lead will review reports and determine appropriate action
